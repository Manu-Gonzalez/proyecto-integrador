to validate each item in the sequence in turn can be uniquely determined without examining the content or attributes of that item, and without any information about the items in the remainder of the sequence.„Wildcard '{0}' allows element '{1}', and causes the content model to become ambiguous. A content model must be formed such that during validation of an element information item sequence, the particle contained directly, indirectly or implicitly therein with which to attempt to validate each item in the sequence in turn can be uniquely determined without examining the content or attributes of that item, and without any information about the items in the remainder of the sequence.L'all' is not the only particle in a group, or is being used as an extension.GThe content type of the base type must not be a simple type definition.;The '{0}' schema does not exist in the XmlSchemaCollection.hCarriage return (#xD), line feed (#xA), and tab (#x9) characters are not allowed in xs:normalizedString.}The content type of the base type must be a simple type definition or it must be mixed, and simpleType child must be present.çline-feed (#xA) or tab (#x9) characters, leading or trailing spaces and sequences of one or more spaces (#x20) are not allowed in 'xs:token'.]The attribute '{0}' does not match one of the four allowed attributes in the 'xsi' namespace.PAn attribute of type NOTATION must not be declared on an element declared EMPTY.0This NOTATION should be used only on attributes.ÓNOTATION cannot be used directly in a schema; only dat
